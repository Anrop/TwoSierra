<font color='#9DA698'>
Soborian Separatists have increased their efforts to gain more territory in East Chernarus. Recent efforts have caused numerous civilian casualties. After months of negotiations, The Red Cross finally got permission to create a mobile field hospital (MARY) in the conflict zone. The hospital treats more than 100 civilian casualties per day and therefore requires sufficient medical supplies.<br />
The last two medical supply transports carried out by the Red Cross were captured by Soborian Separatists. The supplies were sold on the black market. The Red Cross has asked NATO to carry out the supply runs until things have calmed down.

Each mission has its own 'Mission Objectives Test Script' to test mission critical triggers and exfil. The script works in a dedicated server environment and can be evoked by a server admin (or anyone who has server admin access).<br/><br/>
1. Make sure you are logged in as server admin<br/>
2. Hit the escape key to bring up the 'debug console';<br/>
3. In the execute window enter: null = execVM 'mots.sqf';<br/>
4. Click on SERVER EXEC (or LOCAL EXEC if you are testing<br/>
   in the mission editor);<br/>
5. Follow instructions as presented on screen in-game.<br/><br/>
Please note that when testing from within the ARMA III editor, the mission load time is longer as the client (player) and the server are considered the same.

Two Sierra Tour 1 | Takistan, May 2019. On 11 February 2019 the Taliban ceased to exist after a coalition forces UAV successfully targeted and killed the entire Taliban leadership council. The majority of Taliban fighters joined The Pashtun within the following weeks.

<font size='14' color='#d7dbd5'>THE PASHTUN</font><br/>

<font color='#9DA698'>
The Pashtun are a race of warriors who originate from Afghanistan, Takistan and Pakistan. The Pashtun consists of about sixty tribes, each with its own territory.<br/><br/>

The Pashtun has rapidly been expanding its foothold in Asia and the Middle East after the fall of the Taliban, and previously the fall of IS and other factions. The Pashtun are well funded, moderately well organized and very ambitious. Little is known about their goals as they keep a low public relations profile. Intelligence agencies are busy mapping the Pashtun organization. So far reliable intelligence is scares at best.<br/><br/>

CSAT has on several occasions tried to open diplomatic channels. Up till now the Pashtun and CSAT are maintaining neutral relations. Allied Command Operations (ACO) is monitoring the CSAT/Pashtun situation closely.<br/><br/>
Currently The Pashtun are moderately armed with mostly small arms and 2nd generation RPG’s. The BBC reported last week that The Pashtun are in progress of purchasing Iranian-made APC’s and M-ATV’s.
