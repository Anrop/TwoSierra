<font color='#9DA698'>
NATO PR had to do did a spin on the downed UH-80 (XRAY) story for the media when OpFor released photos of the crash site to Al Jazeera. The story is that OpFor shot down a NATO transport helicopter that was picking a NATO medical relief team. The gruesome photos show the KIA crew and a sergeant from 4 PLT.<br/><br/>
BEARCLAW is a NATO intelligence asset who has been in deep cover with the Pashtun Yaqubzai tribe, approx. 40 Km’s south of ALPHA. BEARCLAW possesses crucial intel. It is top priority that BEARCLAW makes it back to HQ alive.<br/><br/>
Last night the story broke that CSAT and Pashtun leaders have engaged into ‘diplomatic discussions’. At the time of writing little is known about the nature of these discussions. MOTHER is in constant contact with CSAT. FIRESTONE will keep you posted of any developments pertinent to your mission.

Each mission has its own 'Mission Objectives Test Script' to test mission critical triggers and exfil. The script works in a dedicated server environment and can be evoked by a server admin (or anyone who has server admin access).<br/><br/>
1. Make sure you are logged in as server admin<br/>
2. Hit the escape key to bring up the 'debug console';<br/>
3. In the execute window enter: null = execVM 'mots.sqf';<br/>
4. Click on SERVER EXEC (or LOCAL EXEC if you are testing<br/>
   in the mission editor);<br/>
5. Follow instructions as presented on screen in-game.<br/><br/>
Please note that when testing from within the ARMA III editor, the mission load time is longer as the client (player) and the server are considered the same.

<font color='#9DA698'>
Two Sierra Tour 1 | Takistan, May 2019. On 11 February 2019 the Taliban ceased to exist after a coalition forces UAV successfully targeted and killed the entire Taliban leadership council. The majority of Taliban fighters joined The Pashtun within the following weeks.

<font size='14' color='#d7dbd5'>THE PASHTUN</font><br/>

<font color='#9DA698'>
The Pashtun are a race of warriors who originate from Afghanistan, Takistan and Pakistan. The Pashtun consists of about sixty tribes, each with its own territory.<br/><br/>

The Pashtun has rapidly been expanding its foothold in Asia and the Middle East after the fall of the Taliban, and previously the fall of IS and other factions. The Pashtun are well funded, moderately well organized and very ambitious. Little is known about their goals as they keep a low public relations profile. Intelligence agencies are busy mapping the Pashtun organization. So far reliable intelligence is scares at best.<br/><br/>

CSAT has on several occasions tried to open diplomatic channels. Up till now the Pashtun and CSAT are maintaining neutral relations. Allied Command Operations (ACO) is monitoring the CSAT/Pashtun situation closely.<br/><br/>
Currently The Pashtun are moderately armed with mostly small arms and 2nd generation RPG’s. The BBC reported last week that The Pashtun are in progress of purchasing Iranian-made APC’s and M-ATV’s.
